## What is a commit?
   commit
   (n) A single point in the Git history; the entire history of a project is represented as a set of interrelated commits. The word "commit" is often used by Git in the same places other revision control systems use the words "revision" or "version". Also used as a short hand for commit object.  
   (v) Storing a new snapshot of the projectâ€™s state in the Git history by creating a new commit representing the current state of the index and advancing HEAD to point at the new commit.
