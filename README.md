## Update a forked repo on GitHub
As your fork only exists on GitHub, and GitHub does not have tools for doing merges through the web interface, you must do the upstream merge locally and then push the changes back to your fork.

1. `git` remote add upstream *URL*
1. `git` fetch upstream
1. `git` checkout master 
1. `git` rebase upstream/master
1. `git` push -f origin master

### Jim Parker's recipe

```bash
git checkout master
git fetch upstream
git reset --hard upstream/master
git push origin master --force
```

Creates new branches for tasks.
Push branches to remote fork (avoid merging master).


## What is a commit?
   commit  
   (n) A single point in the Git history; the entire history of a project is represented as a set of interrelated commits. The word "commit" is often used by Git in the same places other revision control systems use the words "revision" or "version". Also used as a short hand for commit object.  
   (v) Storing a new snapshot of the projectâ€™s state in the Git history by creating a new commit representing the current state of the index and advancing HEAD to point at the new commit.

`git pull` ~= `git fetch` + `git merge FETCH_HEAD`  
`git pull` merges into the _current_ branch  
`git push` does not automatically merge
