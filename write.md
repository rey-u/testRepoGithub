Writing is the main phase of the content development process. Although it can take some time to actually write content, with proper planning and design, the writing phase should take about as long as the other phases.
The writing phase completes when a draft, including relevant media files, is written, checked for style errors, and staged in a release branch in preparation for a pull request.
