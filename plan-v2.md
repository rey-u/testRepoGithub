# Planning your content

This article identifies and defines the tasks that comprise content planning. It is one of a set of articles that are designed to help you develop and maintain quality content.

The purpose of this phase is to get the project off to an effective start by making sure the customer is identified and the scope of the project is clearly understood.

Planning is the initial phase of the content development process, beginning when a need for content is identified. This need can be based on upcoming releases or current gaps in content.
Planning ends when the type of content to be generated is agreed upon, the customer is well-understood, stakeholders are established, and content publication timelines are set.

Content development plans can be tracked by various means, such as in Azure DevOps, Excel, GitHub, Teams, Planner, or Outlook.
