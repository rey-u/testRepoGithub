# Maintain your content

This article identifies and defines the tasks that comprise content maintenance. It is one of a set of articles that are designed to help you develop and maintain quality content.

The purpose of this phase is to ensure content continues to meet customer expectations.

Maintenence is the final, ongoing phase of the content development process. Although it occurs after the content has ben substantively developed, and it might involve content that wasn't yours to begin with, maintenance is as important as any other content development phase.

Content should be monitored indirectly, as through metrics or customer feedback, as well as directly, as by content review for up-to-date references and discoverability.
Content contributors should evaluate the fitness of content and decide how best to improve the content, including possibly standing the content down.

Finding opportunities to extend and improve content can trigger another round of planning and often loops you back to the beginning of the content development process.


## Content maintenance tasks

> [!NOTE]
> Links in the task column below go to detailed task documentation for that entry.

|  | Task | Description |
|-|-|-|
|  | [Triage and address customer feedback]() | As internal and external feedback is received, identified issues should be triaged as per the process for the specific article. After issues are addressed, you should open a pull request to accept and merge any updates.|
||*Receive customer feedback · Triage customer feedback · Address customer feedback*||
|  | [Optimize content]() | Content publication is based on prioritization. This means you may have to defer specific content development until a later point. You can optimize existing content by identifying ways to increase its value to the customer.|
||*Align to best practice · Address content issues*||
|  | [Validate freshness]() | The longer content has been published on the live site, the more likely it should be reviewed for accuracy. Dependencies, brand names, and metadata can change over time.|
|  | [Review non-performing content]() | Content might not receive feedback or views for various reasons. It might not be sufficiently targeted or detailed, or users might be looking for it somewhere else. Under-performing content should be addressed as too much of it damages customer trust in the effectiveness of the knowledge base.|
|  | [Retire out-of-date content]() | |
