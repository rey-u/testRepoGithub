# Planning your content
![Article creation process - Plan](./media/content-dev/1-plan.svg)

Note that when you engage in the planning process *varies*. Depending on the PM team you're working with, some may be more proactive with advance notice of new feature development, so you can start planning out content during development. Other groups might postpone engagement until after implementation, requesting documentation before launch.

|Subtask|Begins with|Ends by
| :-- | :-- | :-- 
|Identify stakeholders|Stakeholders are usually previously identified based on existing relationships and types of work. Commonly these relationships would be with feature PMs, marketing PMMs, Cloud Advocates, or team leads.|- Content is assigned for all upcoming features for product teams.<br/>- Content is aligned to marketing/growth initiatives.
|Identify necessary content|- An identified stakeholder informs you of plans for what feature announcements are coming in the next cycle – depending on permutation.<br/>- You and your stakeholders identify together what content needs are required for an upcoming release and prioritize appropriately.|Tracking items are created to track the required upcoming outputs. This could occur in Azure DevOps, Excel, GitHub, Teams, Outlook, etc.
|Identify the customer|- Depending on content developer, customer may either be pre-established during product design phase or customer may be known through existing documentation.<br/>- If the service is brand-new, then the product design phase should have that customer type captured and should be communicated to the content developer.|Customer has been confirmed between stakeholders and content developer and has been used to generate intent statement of some kind that shows agreement between stakeholders and content developer.
|Identify user scenarios|Customer and stakeholders are identified.|Stakeholders and content developer determine that the scenarios are clearly defined and ready for content development.
|Identify pain points|- Scenario has been agreed-upon by stakeholders.<br/>- Discussion begins around pain points.|Pain points have been identified and added as notes near intent statement.
|Prioritize upcoming work|- Scenarios and pain points have been agreed-upon within stakeholder group.<br/>- Initial content plan is set for what content needs to support the release.|Content plans are set with timelines for when to publish the next pieces of content.
|Identify existing content to use|Searching across the Microsoft content ecosystem begins, using the shared understanding of the collective agreement for prioritization.|Relevant content from all stakeholder sources has been reviewed for inclusion/exclusion in upcoming content.
|Assign resources|- Content plan has been completed within team.<br/>- Content to-be-developed has been assigned and agreed-upon by each stakeholder.|Content tasks are assigned per the established plan.
|Upskill on the feature|Resources have been assigned per the content development plan.|The content developer feels confident in their ability to describe the feature.  

### Identify upcoming features

- https://review.docs.microsoft.com/help/contribute/case-studies (Everything within this TOC node)

When you're talking with PMs, not only are they telling you about new features coming out, but you're also getting some feedback about relative priorities so you can determine which features are important and should be worked on next. You can easily have two year's worth of work lined up, but you must judge which is so important and impactful that it should be done first. You might spend a lot of time gathering the information necessary to make these judgement calls.

Priorities do sometimes change; you can be in a PR or waiting for review when a content effort drops in priority. Depending on the team, priorities could shift infrequently or it could occur quite a bit.
Teams may have competing deliverables and the sequence of what the team plans to produce can change, especially if there are a lot of deliverables to produce in a short period of time (for example, with JEDI).


### Identify ongoing (weekly, biweekly) feature changes or releases
### Identify new docsets for new services
### Identify content needed for events (e.g., Build)
### If you were involved in designing the feature
- Write docs/other comms ~ 3 weeks prior to product launch (part of release readiness)
   - Docs is part of doing the job for Go To Market
- Pin down issues from devs
- Verify monthly what the priorities are for the docs
- Was there something reviews? (sic) Was there something in progress? Right-to-left.
- Content dev releases scenario content (create narrative for feature docs)

### Document product features
### Identify existing content to use or update
- https://review.docs.microsoft.com/help/contribute/contribute-content-release-planning (Whole TOC node) 
- https://review.docs.microsoft.com/help/contribute/contribute-unified-content-model (Determine whether content type needs to be created for release)

### Prioritize upcoming work
- https://review.docs.microsoft.com/help/contribute/contribute-content-release-planning (Whole TOC node)

As a contributor, you might have multiple areas of responsibility where there are competing priorities. Projects may be at different stages at different times, and juggling this priority is part of the work of a contributor. For example, you could be simultaneously on the Design phase for Project A and the Publish phase for Project B.

### Identify customer pain points

- https://review.docs.microsoft.com/help/contribute/contribute-get-started-mvc (Table> Milestone 1) 

Part of planning involves determining who the best point of contact is for content development, support, or validation.

### Identify the customer

- https://review.docs.microsoft.com/help/contribute/contribute-developer-quickstarts (QuickStart Reference specific guidance)

This isn't user stories in the "Dev Ops" feature (?). "User stories" might also be referred to as "scenarios," that is, the story that you want to tell in the context of an individual doc (rather than how you're going to track the work for it).

When you're identifying upcoming features with your PM team, you might ask, "What is someone going to do with this? What's the actual user experience?" This might influence the kinds of articles you need, or how many articles you might write (design considerations).
"What do the users care about?" "What do they need to know?" "How can we help them be successful with our technology?"

### Assign resources

|Align scenario to pain points|- Voice of the customer is tracked<br/>- When Customers pain points are identified and prioritized.<br/>- To help decide the structure of content. What does the customer need first?|Identified scenarios are aligned with pain points.
|Determine content structure|- Before writing documentation for steps that are common across other services or across other articles within same doc set.<br/>- For developer content, writing steps for same feature but on multiple IDE, Shell. What part to pivot in TOC to handle variations that come up with what customers need and how they want to experience.|- Content types are identified<br/>- Structure of Table of Content(TOC) is defined<br/>- Shared or common content is identified - to use include files<br/>- Content for zone pivots is identified.
|Cross service content|- When there is any cross service content involved<br/>- If you need to place an article on two different TOCs/module in two different learning paths/collections|- Content dependencies across services/products are identified<br/>- Plan is developed to figure out how content might work across services  
|Write customer intent statements|Content structure(TOC) and content types are identified|Include the tasks and a customer intent statement for each article in TOC.
|Identify SEO terms||
|Identify terms to use throughout *Docs*|Plan approved for documentation for new product or service|- Finalized terminology that will be used consistently across documentation<br/>- Finalized Brand name to use on public facing sites<br/>- Approved Metadata values added to allow list 


## Align scenarios to pain points
- https://review.docs.microsoft.com/help/contribute/contribute-get-started-mvc (top tasks; not very clear existing guidance)

Documentation as support
Similarly, in your space you might be documenting new scenarios. New scenarios might not necessarily be even a pain point, but just something that's important to the business. For example, we might document how people adopt a product through a particular scenario because we know they care about it.

# Writing your content
![Article creation process - Write](./media/content-dev/3-write.svg)

|Subtask|Begins with|Ends by
| :-- | :-- | :--
|Create a release branch|The Product and Content team has decided that content is kept internal and is not published until a specified date. A release branch is a git branch that is created to hold documentation that needs to be hidden from the public. Therefore, a release branch is isolated from the master branch.|A release branch is created in the upstream private repo and its name is shared with all authors collaborating on content release. Typically the release branch is named with the scheme release-<conference>-<technology> or simply release-<technology> 
|Create a public repo (for code)||- Go visit your new repo on GitHub to confirm it was created correctly, or <br/>- Record your work in the original work item and set the state of the work item to closed.
|Write code|Before you create an article, think about how to lead a user through creating a proof of concept.|- Develop piece of code that you trust<br/>- Tested out the scenario
|Write first draft of content|The authoring environment is set, remotes are set, local branch is created|When markdown files for your articles are created
|Create TOC|New conceptual articles in md or yaml format are created. They can be quickstarts, tutorials, samples, overview etc.|All the new conceptual articles created are linked from TOC
|Make content discoverable|Figure out how customers are going to find this documentation/content for appropriate searches.|New conceptual articles written in md. yml have all the required metadata, SEO basics applied 
|Identify rich media|- When you need to clarify instructions and provide helpful context in an article<br/>- When you identify the requirement to add a media file in the form or screenshot, conceptual art, or animated GIF to your article.<br/>- When you have steps that aren't obvious|- Need for conceptual artwork, videos are identified<br/>- Request for rich media is completed
|Create rich media|- After you identify the requirement to add a media file in the form or screenshot, conceptual art, or animated GIF to your article.|- Media assets are created<br/>- Media files are saved on ‘media’ folder<br/>- Media files are referenced with correct markdown syntax from articles
|Check Acrolinx score on VS Code|-Content is written in Markdown text, and article saved with the .md extension<br/>- Acrolinx score along with issues is displayed for each article on VS Code |- Acrolinx score for each article the contributor creates is > 85<br/>- Local preview of article is shown on VS Code window 
|Submit pull request to stage content|When your content is added to your local branch and you are now ready to push it to upstream repo|- When your pull request is successfully built without any warnings, suggestions or errors<br/>- Acrolinx score report is shown on PR comments<br/>- If PR review is enabled for the repo, Preview links are displayed on PR comments
|Validate the technical accuracy of *Docs*|- When your first draft is completed, AND<br/>- When any article has code, or steps for a procedure|- Successful completion of end to end procedure without any errors following the documentation.<br/>- Code snippets added on articles run without errors.
|Address *Docs* validation errors|When PR is opened against upstream branch and build has failed with errors|- Pull request is successfully built without any warnings, suggestions or errors<br/>- Acrolinx score report link is shown on PR comment<br/>- If PR review is enabled for the repo, Preview links are displayed on PR comment

|Subtask|Begins with|Ends by
| :-- | :-- | :--
|Distribute doc for review|You've written, or updated, an article and created the GitHub pull request. You can now invite others to review your work and provide feedback.|You have added your reviewers to the pull request.
|Address reviewer feedback|Feedback has been received from reviewers.|Review related changes are committed to the PR. All feedback addressed.
|Debug publishing platform|One of a range of symptoms reported through GitHub UI after a PR created or updated. Could be a doc build or validation error that doesn’t block build (example: bad link, missing metadata) to a complete build failure. Sometimes  a build takes an unusually long time or fails without reporting anything through the GitHub UI.|- Docs build runs and stages content without reporting errors<br/>- There are no errors or warnings from the build process, and all merge conflicts have been resolved. The PR is mergeable.
|Address Acrolinx feedback (from the build report)|The contributor clicks the Acrolinx Scorecard link in the pull request.|The .md file is updated to address the score. This can be done multiple times.
|Address PR reviewer feedback|- PR reviewer sends feedback in response to 1) PR sign-off, or<br/>- 2) contributor request.|Contributor signs off on PR, or<br/>- PR is merged.
|Provide feedback|Based on the existing diagram flow, this is not sequential and stands outside the other tasks in this category because the rest of the task assume the contributor versus reviewer role. This task begins when the “reviewer” is notified that a review has been requested of them.|This task ends when the reviewer submits their feedback to the contributor (in the pull request?).
|Sign-off/merge pull request|Type #sign-off in the comments field of the PR (or repo-specific equivalent)|PR is merged by the PR reviewer.

Working with Service Team content
Non-writers might want a conceptual review of how new content fits into a documentation set. Or, they might want an editorial pass of a change to existing documentation. This effort could involve a slight educational component, instructing new PMs on the PR process, for example. At this stage, feedback would primarily occur in a PR (in the Plan and Design stages, it's usually in a Word doc).
